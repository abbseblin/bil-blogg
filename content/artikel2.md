<h2 class="text-3xl">What's the Difference Between a Turbocharger and a Supercharger?</h2>

"Supercharger" is the generic term for an air compressor used to increase the pressure or density of air entering an engine,
providing more oxygen with which to burn fuel. The earliest superchargers were all driven by power taken from the crankshaft,
typically by gear, belt, or chain. A turbocharger is simply a supercharger that is powered instead by a turbine in the exhaust
stream. The first of these, dating to 1915, were referred to as turbosuperchargers and were employed on radial aircraft engines
to boost their power in the thinner air found at higher altitudes. That name was first shortened to turbocharger and then to
turbo. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Which Is Better: Turbo- or Supercharger?</h2>

Each can be used to increase power, fuel economy, or both, and each has pros and cons. Turbochargers capitalize on some of the
"free" energy that would otherwise be completely lost in the exhaust. Driving the turbine does increase exhaust backpressure,
which exerts some load on the engine, but the net loss tends to be less by comparison with the direct mechanical load that
driving a supercharger involves (the biggest blowers powering a top-fuel dragster consume 900 crankshaft horsepower in an engine
rated at 7,500 total horsepower). <br> <br>

But superchargers can provide their boost almost instantly, whereas turbochargers typically
suffer some response lag while the exhaust pressure required to spin the turbine builds. Clearly a top-fuel dragster trying to
run the quarter in four seconds has no time to waste waiting for exhaust pressure to build, so they all use superchargers, while
vehicles tasked with boosting a company's corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) can't afford to squander precious horsepower on
blowers, so they mostly use turbos. <br> <br>

But with the rise of mild hybridization and 48-volt electrical systems, you can expect to
see greater use of superchargers driven by freely recuperated electricity stored during deceleration and braking.
Mercedes-Benz's new M256 six-cylinder now arriving in vehicles like the CLS 450 and GLE 450 uses just such a system, as does the
similarly sized and configured range-topping engine in the new Land Rover Defender. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">How Much Power Does a Turbo or Supercharger Add?</h2>

Above we noted that the amount of oxygen that an engine can "breathe" is the limiting factor as to how much power it can produce, because fuel-injector technology is more than capable of supplying as much fuel as can possibly be burned with the amount of oxygen in the cylinder. Naturally aspirated engines operating at sea level get air at 14.7 psi, so if a turbo or supercharger adds 7 psi of boost to an engine, then the cylinders themselves are getting roughly 50 percent more air and should theoretically be able to produce about 50 percent more power.<br> <br>
It doesn't usually work out that way. Compressing intake air adds heat, which along with the added pressure increases the likelihood of engine-damaging pre-detonation or "ping," so the timing often has to be retarded somewhat. This can limit the amount of time the fuel has to completely burn, and hence erodes some of the power gain. Most modern engines running turbos and/or superchargers also include intercoolers to help remove some of the heat added by the turbo or supercharger. In the end, the typical expectation is that adding 50 percent more air yields 30 to 40 percent more power. <br> <br>
