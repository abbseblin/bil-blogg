<h1 class="text-4xl">What Is the Difference Between Diesel and Gas?</h1> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Engine Operation</h2>

In the basic sense, gas and diesel engines have similar operations. Both engines use internal combustion and a series of rapid explosions within the engine to turn fuel into mechanical energy and propel a vehicle forward. The difference is how these explosions occur. <br><br>

In a gasoline engine, the fuel mixes with air compressed by pistons. The spark plugs ignite this mixture to move the vehicle. On the other hand, in a diesel engine, the air is first compressed. This makes the air hot. The fuel then ignites when it hits the hot air.<br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Fuel injection</h2>

Gasoline and diesel engines inject fuel in different ways. In a gasoline engine, fuel injection can occur two ways: a port injection system or a carburetor. The port injection system injects air into the fuel right before the intake stroke. In contrast, a carburetor mixes the fuel and air together before sending it into the cylinder to compress. <br> <br>

In a diesel engine, the fuel is injected directly into the cylinder. Since this process is a crucial part of how diesel engines work, the diesel injectors can become a complicated part of the process. In order to deliver the fine mist of fuel necessary for the process to work, the injectors must be able to withstand high temperatures and a large amount of pressure. To this day, engineers are working to make this system more efficient. <br> <br>

Examples of engine advancements include engine control modules and glow plugs. Engine control modules use numerous sensors to correctly time the injection, and a glow plug is a hot wire that can quickly raise the air temperature in a cold engine to help it start more efficiently. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Power output</h2>

When youâ€™re researching your new vehicle options, you might see a lot of talk about horsepower and torque. Horsepower is a measurement of power, and torque is a measurement of the twisting force on the driveline in the engine. <br> <br>

If your vehicle has plenty of horsepower but little torque, it will be slow to get moving. Torque is what gets vehicles going. Diesel engines tend to have higher torque but less horsepower. This is why sports cars usually have gasoline engines and big trucks typically have diesel engines. Sports cars need the extra horsepower that gasoline offers, and big trucks need that extra torque from a diesel engine to move heavy loads. <br> <br>
