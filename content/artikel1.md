<h1 class="text-4xl"> The Magical Work Of An Internal Combustion Engine </h1> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Basics</h2>

The internal combustion engine uses a combination of air, fuel and spark to keep itself running.
The kind of engine most of us think about when we hear the word engine is a normal 4-stroke engine.
The 4-stroke engine has (as its name suggests) 4 strokes.

<h3 class="text-2xl">Intake Stroke</h3>
While the intake stroke happens a mix of air and fuel gets mixed. The fuel can mix with the air either in the intake manifold or in the combustion chamber by direct injection. As you see in the picture above the piston moves down to bottom dead center (BDC) so the air/fuel mixture can be injected. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Compression Stroke</h3>
The compression stroke is when the air/fuel mixture compresses as much as possible in order to get as much energy out of the mixture. The compressed gas is now ready to ignite. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Power Stroke</h3>
The power stroke is when the compressed air/fuel mixture ignites. The ignition of the mix forces the piston down to BDC. When the piston is close to BDC the exhaust valve opens. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Exhaust Stroke</h3>
When the exhaust stroke is ongoing the combustion chamber is full of exhausts. As mentioned the exhaust valve opened a bit earlier and it keeps open under the whole stroke. The crankshaft pushes the piston up to TDC which leads to the exhaust going out through the valves and in to the exhaust.

<h2 class="text-3xl">components</h2>
A traditional 4-stroke engine is built up by many components. But the most important and noticeable ones are the crankshaft, piston/connecting rod and piston. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">How to service and maintain</h2>
Properly maintaining your car is key to keeping it in top condition. It can also help ensure your safety, the safety of your passengers and your fellow drivers. Here are some ways to help keep your car running smoothly. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">The Car Maintenance Checklist</h3>

Consider adding these items to your vehicle maintenance "to do" list:
Inspect and Maintain Tires <br>

Knowing how to maintain your car's tire pressure can help reduce wear on the tires and helps ensure you're getting good gas mileage. Checking your tire pressure includes finding the recommended pressure, checking the PSI and inflating or deflating your tires accordingly. <br> <br>

A flat tire is a hazard that can be dangerous to you and your car. There are several preventative steps you can take to help avoid a blowout, including rotating your tires every 5,000 to 10,000 miles and watching for tire recalls. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Change the oil</h3>

Routinely checking and changing your car's oil is essential to keeping its engine in running condition. Check your oil each month and change it as directed in the car's owner's manual. <br>

You can change your oil yourself or take it to a service center. If you choose to do it yourself, learn the necessary steps to drain the fluid, set the correct oil level and dispose of old oil. <br> <br>

You should also know which type of motor oil is best for your car, regardless of whether you change the oil yourself or take it to a service center. This generally means considering three things — the oil viscosity, whether to use synthetic versus non-synthetic oil and your car's mileage. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Check the fluids</h3>

There are several fluids that should be kept at the appropriate levels to help keep your car running properly. According to Popular Mechanics, you or your mechanic should check: <br> <br>

Engine oil <br>
Coolant <br>
Power steering fluid <br>
Brake fluid <br>
Transmission fluid <br> <br>

A leak with any of these fluids can affect the way your car drives. If you spot a leak, you may be able to identify the fluid by its color. This can help you and your mechanic determine where the leak is coming from. It can also help speed up the repair process. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Test the lights</h3>

A broken or burnt-out bulb is a safety hazard and might get you a ticket. Learn how to thoroughly inspect each bulb on your car. If a bulb is out, take your car to an expert to determine whether it's the bulb or the fuse that needs replacing.

Headlights are key safety lights on your car. Consider taking a few extra steps to help keep them shining bright, such as cleaning the lenses and replacing bulbs as they start to dim. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Replace windshield wipers</h3>

If your wipers aren't working like they used to, don't let the problem linger. Damaged or worn out blades can reduce visibility during a heavy rain or a snowstorm. Knowing how to inspect your wiper blades regularly and replace them when necessary is one way to help keep your car safe. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Change the engine air filter</h3>

A dirty engine air filter can allow dirt and other particulates into your car's engine and reduce its efficiency. Inspect your car's air filter once a year and replace it as needed. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">regular check-ups</h3>

Some routine car care tasks can be done at home, but others require trained technicians. Take your car to a technician if the check engine light comes on. Trained technicians can diagnose the problem through the car's on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) port.

A qualified repair shop will also be able to inspect and replace other core components like the alternator and the wheel bearings. Scheduling regular tune-ups will help ensure that your car gets other maintenance items repaired as well. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Have your brakes checked</h3>

Your car's brake pads also require regular inspection. While driving, listen for any brake noise and pay attention to shuddering or vibrating from the brake pedal. If any concerns arise, consult a service center as soon as possible <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Wash your cat</h3>

Your car is subjected to all sorts of elements, from road salt and ice melt in the winter to tree sap and bird droppings in the summer. Some of these hazards are not only unsightly but can cause damage to paint and the undercarriage, according to AccuWeather.

Keeping your car clean may help prevent long-term damage. Find the car washing method that works for you and regularly wash your car. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Check belts and hoses</h3>

Keeping your car's belts and hoses in good shape can help keep your car running and may help you avoid a breakdown on the road. For example, if your serpentine belt breaks while you're driving, it may cause many of your car's systems to fail.

Having your belts and hoses checked at every oil change will help ensure that they're in good condition and don't need replacing. <br> <br>

<h3 class="text-2xl">Review your cars insurance</h3>

Just like regular car checkups, it's a good idea to review your car insurance policy from time to time. This can help ensure your policy's coverages, limits and deductibles are up-to-date and suitable for your current situation.

Keeping your car in good shape can help keep you and your passengers safe. And remember, if you're ever unsure about how to inspect or replace a car part, be sure to contact a local mechanic for help. <br> <br>
