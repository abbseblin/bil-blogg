<h1 class="text-4xl">MORE POWER!!!!</h1> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Upgrade the air intake</h2>
Most budding gearheads start here. Upgrading to a cold-air intake is relatively simple and can provide a noticeable power boost. <br> <br>
Cold-air intakes help eliminate the sharp bends and restrictive air passages inherent to some stock intakes. Abrupt transitions and sharp edges in the intake create turbulence, which leads to power loss. <br> <br>

Increased airflow triggers the computer to add more fuel to the fuel/air mix. More fuel/air equals more power. Cold-air intakes also, as the name implies, draw cooler air from outside the engine compartment. Cooler air is more dense, again resulting in the computer increasing the amount of fuel, helping the engine make more power. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Upgrade the exhaust</h2>
More air entering the engine means more air has to exit the engine. <br> <br>

While many stock exhaust systems can handle the added air from an upgraded intake, consider upgrading to a catback exhaust or high-flow catalytic converter, especially if you’ve already modified your engine to make more power. <br> <br>

A catback exhaust includes everything installed after the catalytic converter, including the resonator, exhaust piping and muffler. It’s typically designed with larger-diameter parts compared to the stock exhaust, allowing greater airflow. Since it includes everything after the catalytic converter, you don’t run the risk of disrupting your vehicle’s emissions system by messing around with the catalytic converter. <br> <br>

Even so, a stock catalytic converter can restrict airflow and reduce power, making it a prime target for an upgrade. A high-flow catalytic converter features larger openings on either end, increasing airflow and power. <br> <br>

<h2 class="text-3xl">Install a performance tuner</h2>
Sometimes called “chips,” performance tuners plug into the diagnostic port. They modify the fuel and timing maps to increase performance, typically at the expense of fuel economy. Some performance tuners can improve fuel economy, though. <br> <br>

Tuners are especially popular among diesel owners. They’re about the simplest upgrade to install available on the market. <br> <br>
